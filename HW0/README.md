- I am deeply interested in Android Development. I have already taken four Android Development courses during my Associates at Seattle Central College. My long term goal is to seek out a career as an Android Developer at Google. I was in fact dissapointed with how little we will be spending with Android Development in this Bachelor's Program.
- During this course, I will make sure to backup my code consistently with git to prevent loss of work.
